Code for running the DQN and categorical Q-learning algorithms with the Fourier basis and neural network function approximators can be found in the two folders. In both cases, training.py contains the main method function. Most of the parameters for the algorithms are set in the initialization segment of DQNAgent in agent.py and descriptions of the parameters are given there. Additional parameters are defined in config.py and passed as arguments to config in the initialization of DQNAgent. Descriptions for those parameters can be found in config.py. Parameter settings that control what tests are done are set inside of the main method. To change what loss function is being used for distributional learning go to the loss function in the CategoricalDQNAgent and comment in/out the appropriate lines.
